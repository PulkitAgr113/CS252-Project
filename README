Syntax for running: ./run.sh <path-to-testcase> <number-of-clients> <phase>
For eg: ./run.sh ./tc18 18 3

This will store your output for phase 3 in a folder called output, while actually downloading the required files in the testcase folder itself.

tc18 is a sample test case with 18 clients, with the folder sol18 containing files ans_x_y, which is the expected output of client x on phase y.

To check the correctness of the code, run the following code: ./diff.sh <path-to-solutions> <number-of-clients> <phase>
For eg: ./diff.sh ./sol18 18 3

This will generate files representing the differences between the expected and the obtained output in the diffs folder.
